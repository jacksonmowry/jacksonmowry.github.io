* Review
The authors of this paper were seeking to create a real-time /Artifical Intelligence of Things/ classifier. This classifier would serve as a general purpose device which could be put in place in medical or other settings where low power and low latency are required. They solved the power problem by placing an additional /always-on/ detection layer before the full processing higher power layers.

This layer consists of a spiking neural network, which uses temporally encoded spikes to determine if some event of interest is occurring. These signals are then sent to a second pre-processing layer which records the start and end time of an event. Once the event is detected it can be sent to the traditional Von-neumann computer for further processing.

The entire pre-processing layer is implemented in a clock-free manner, meaning that all layers of the computation can occur simultaneously. Additionally, this allows the SNN to be sampled for a result as soon as the event ends, as all previous "frames" will have already been processed.

This processing occurs within a 5 layer network, with each layer being fulled connected. Synaptic connections do not have delay, and their charge is stored as a 4-bit signed integer.

Overall, their device exhibited incredible latency, with average efficiency, and a poor accuracy. The authors cite the fact that their training environment did not match the inference environment, leading to different results in training an inference.
