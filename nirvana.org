#+title: Nirvana

* Primitives
** Input
- Seems pretty simple, N dimensional
- Could be implemented as a flat layer with additional metadata describing the shape
- Additionally, this can probably get folded into the actual neurons, there is no point in having an additional layer as far as I can tell
** Output
- Same as above
** Affine
- Looks like a linear equation, Wx+b
- W and b appear to be provided as parameters
** Convolution
- P complicated
- Kernel is described as W, rest of the parameters seems self explanatory
** Delay
- Real numbered delay (yikes)
- Computation is described as grabbing the charge from T time steps in the past
- Probably don't implement it is described above, but we'll see
** Flatten
- Simply a description of how to map between 2 layers, will only exist at the synapse level
** Integrator
- For some reason this has a scalar on the integrator??
- I guess we would consider this to always be 1 in RISP?
** Leaky Integrator
- Some constant amount of leak?
- This equation doesn't make a whole lot of sense
** Linear/Scale
- These are the same thing?
- Just used to scale a signal I guess
** Spike
- Theta = threshold
* Higher-Order Primitives
** Integrate-and-fire
- Integrator going into a spike, with a linear reset block
** Leaky Integrate and Fire
- Same as above, just leaks
** Current-based leaky integrate-and-fire
- No clue, just seems more complicated

* Plan
- Create a translation layer from TENNLab network into NIR
  - This will allow me to get the concepts/python API under my belt
  - Will also test if other simulators are even worth porting our networks to
- Create a translation layer from NIR to TENNLab networks
  - Depending on how many primitives we'd like to support we can just steal the code/logic from the whetstone conversion program
  - Things we cannot support
    1. Linear/Scale
    2. Affine
- Don't know if there's any reason to build a full NIR compliant simulator?
  - Wouldn't I basically just be building SnnTorch or something similar at that point?
  - We wouldn't be able to use EONS to take full advantage of it's potential
