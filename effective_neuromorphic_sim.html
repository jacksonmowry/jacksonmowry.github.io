<h2 id="org0a8fe41"><span class="underline">The Problem</span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0a8fe41">
<p>
Neuromorphic computing is a proposed alternative computing model that draws heavy inspiration from the functionality of neurons and synapses in the human body. It has come into the spotlight as the progression of Moore&rsquo;s law steadily slowed. Neuromorphic hardware is gradually becoming more popular, with examples like Intel&rsquo;s Loihi, IBM&rsquo;s True North, and many other examples from research labs (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Davies et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Akopyan et al. 2015</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Daffron 2015</a>). Now computing needs to evolve to take advantage of massively parallel hardware since the speed of an individual processor core stagnates.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, the computing model of neurons and synapses is inherently parallel, which proposes quite the challenge when attempting to simulate these systems on traditional hardware. In this article we will look at 2 high level approaches for simulating neuromorphic systems on a single core CPU. This choice should allow the findings to be applicable to the widest range of neuromorphic applications, although our findings will be presented in an embedded context, specifically microcontrollers and single board computers.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org00f74db"><span class="underline">Why</span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org00f74db">
<p>
In order to simulate a neuromorphic system on non-neuromorphic hardware, some level of emulation must be performed. This means simulating both the communication between individual neurons (via synapses), and the storage of charge within an individual neuron. To simplify our model for better understanding we will make the assumption that all charge is leaked from a neuron at the end of each time step.
</p>

<p>
It should also be noted that the optimizations explored here are focused strictly on improving performance in a densely connected network, with high levels of activity. A sparsely connected network with low activity would require different optimizations.

</p>
</div>

<p>
One of the major benefits of a neuromorphic system is that its entire job is to operate on events, and subsequently produce more events. An event-based simulation lends itself to a lazy approach, where only the &ldquo;active&rdquo; parts of a network are performing work. A common implementation uses an event queue (or priority queue), where individual spike propagations are enqueued to be applied to the network at a later time. This approach allows for sparse network to save on simulation cost when little activity is present in the network.
</p>

<p>
Due to the delay of any given synapse having some fixed upper bound in networks, there is no need to maintain a dynamic priority queue, instead each discrete time step can have its own pool of events. By provided a fixed location for events to be placed we can effectively eliminate the need for dynamic memory allocation, while maintaining the same advantages of an event queue. The issue now comes when considering the memory footprint of such a solution.
</p>

<p>
Each possible time step (in this case this is equivalent to the max delay in a network) needs to have the capacity to hold that maximum number of events possible in the network. Therefore, even though this solution is optimized to do the smallest amount of work possible under low network activity conditions, it always consumes more memory.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1798862" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1798862"><span class="underline">Internal Ring Buffer</span></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1798862">
<p>
Instead of storing sparse events in a global container, we can instead store the &ldquo;upcoming&rdquo; state of each neuron internally. Our approach takes the form of a ring buffer within each neuron to store the effective charge at each offset from the current time step. Under this approach each time a neuron fires it propagates a spike down each of its synapses, adding its weight at some offset in the downstream neurons ring buffer.
</p>

<p>
This has the benefit of integrating events into their final sum at the time of firing, reducing the number of tracked states drastically, thus reducing memory used. On processors or platforms with relatively limited cache reducing the overall memory footprint of a simulator can have large benefits on the running time. This is especially important on microcontrollers where limited or no cache is available to speed up execution.
</p>

<p>
Another benefit of this approach is improved spatial locality. Instead of interacting with a large global container storing all activity, we are directly writing/reading from a single neuron at a time. Large arrays are likely to not be entirely resident in cache, meaning we will take the penalty of a cache miss more frequently as jump around to different time steps. In contrast, the embedded ring buffer approach not only lowers the overall size in memory, but it also reduces the number of possible memory location we can write to.
</p>

<p>
However, due to the shift in how our network is represented in memory our computation will also need to change. We can no longer act on only the active neurons, which is a tradeoff we must make in order to support densely connected networks with high activity. Now each neuron is iterated through, checking for to see if it should fire, if not the loop continues on. If the neuron should fire we begin iterating through each of its synapses to apply a charge to any downstream neurons. With the model leak can be applied within the same loop as charges are propagates, further increases time savings.
</p>

<p>
Again, microcontrollers are less sophisticated and thus have much shallower pipelines, leading to less overall cost to branching. Therefore, we can pay the cost of checking if each neuron should fire and still achieve a speedup over the event-based simulation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="org0048c07" class="figure">
<p><img src="risp_ringbuffer.png" alt="risp_ringbuffer.png" width="100%" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In an effort to further reduce out programs memory footprint we can also eliminate the global array of synapses. To allow our system to support a reasonable number of neurons/synapses they have to be referenced with a 2 byte index (65536 possible indexes). The issue is that a synapse itself is only 4 bytes in total, therefore a 2 byte index is 50% overhead.
</p>

<p>
Each synapse represents a relationship between exactly 2 neurons (or a recurrent connection between a neuron and itself), and they are never shared, meaning that a synapse can be embedded within the upstream neuron. This change eliminates the need for the 2 byte index, and further improves spatial locality by bundling neurons with their associated synapses.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It should be noted that this approach requires each neuron to have the same number of synapses. This would likely be a downside for a sparsely connected network, but it proves to be beneficial in networks with dense connectivity.

<div id="outline-container-orge8f6b9e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge8f6b9e"><span class="underline">Flip the Script &amp; Parallelism</span></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge8f6b9e">
<p>
Thus far, we have focused on optimizations for a lower power, potentially single-core processor, yet our system is trying to simulate parallel operation. If hardware is present that enables parallel processing the current model would not scale well to many units of execution. This is due to the fact that we would have contention around &ldquo;firing&rdquo; events. If we imagine each neuron executing independently, two separate neurons may fire, resulting in two spikes propagating to a downstream neuron at the same time. This is the classical <code>i = i+1</code> problem in computer science.
</p>

<p>
Instead, if we think about this problem from the perspective of the downstream neuron, we all but eliminate this issue. Instead of having each neuron propagate a charge downstream, we can have neurons look at their upstream neurons to determine if they fired. This is a bit of backwards way to think about things, but it enables potentially massive parallelism.
</p>

<p>
There are some potential downsides to this parallel approach. First, the system now requires 2 full iterations over all neurons, one to collect charges from all neurons which have fired on this time step, and a second to apply leak to the network. Second, our memory access pattern is much more unpredictable, however, with sufficient parallelism this benefits will outweigh the costs.

<p>
For the purposes of this article we will be analyzing a neuromorphic implementation of the DBScan algorithm (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">Ester et al. 1996</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_9">Rizzo and Plank 2024</a>). The DBScan algorithm is meant to both de-noise an image, and highlight areas of interest, which are identified by density of data. This means that our network is expecting high levels of input activity, a perfect scenario for the proposed optimizations. Another key consideration of neuromorphic DBScan is that the networks are densely connected, with most neurons having 3-4 outgoing synapses. Once again, this means that embedded synapses directly within neurons should net an overall benefit, due to the densely connected nature of our network.
</p>

<p>
DBScan works by analyzing each pixel and determining how many other pixels are in its &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo;, if the number of pixels meets or exceedes at set threshold than that event would be considered a <b>core</b> event. The other two possible classifications are <b>border</b> and <b>noise</b>, where <b>border</b> events are defined as a pixel with a <b>core</b> event within its neighborhood. Both parameters for the neighborhood (epsilon), and threshold (minimum points) are tunable, with an increase in either parameter resulting in a corresponding increase in network size.
</p>

<p>
The network used for testing had 2345 neurons and 6488 synapses, which is quite large for an embedded neuromorphic application. Typical neuromorphic networks for classification or control tasks end up in the tens to hundreds of neurons range (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Ambrose et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_6">Ghawaly et al. 2022</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_8">Patton et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_10">Schuman et al. 2020</a>).

<p>
The original event based simulator was ported to run on a RISC-V microcontroller (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_7">Milk-V-Technology, n.d.</a>), although the hardware used is not necessary to be familiar with to see the benefits. As a starting state we observed a theoretical 7.610 FPS, with approximately 150Kb of memory utilized to run the simulation. This architecture requires more memory than we have L2 cache, meaning that at no point can the entire system be held in cache.
</p>

<p>
Switching from the original event based model to each neuron holding an internal ring buffer drops the overall memory usage from 150Kb to 68Kb, meaning that a simulator can now much more easily fit in a system&rsquo;s cache. Additionally, moving to this computation model further improves performance to a theoretical 10.034 FPS, a 31.9% improvement.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, embedded synapses within a neuron netted a smaller performance increase, resulting in 10.234 FPS, a 34.4% increase over baseline. This architecture also further lowered memory consumption down to 60Kb.
