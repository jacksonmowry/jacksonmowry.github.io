\section{Question 1}
\label{sec:orgc7263ff}
C = \{w | w has an equal number of 0s and 1\}

Assume C is a regular language, and let p be the pumping length of C. Choose \emph{s} = 0\textsuperscript{p}1\textsuperscript{p} \(\in\) C. Clearly |0\textsuperscript{p}1\textsuperscript{p}| \textgreater{} p. According to the pumping lemma, \emph{s} can be paritioned into \emph{s} = xyz \(\in\) C such that for all i \(\ge\) 0, we have the following xy\textsuperscript{i}z \(\in\) C. By condition 3 of the pumping lemma, we must also have |xy| \(\le\) p. Therefore y must consist only of 0's and subsequently xyyz = xy\textsuperscript{2}z \(\notin\) F since the string \emph{s} would now contain a greater number of 0s than 1s. Subsequently if we pumped down, resulting in a string of xz, the string would now contain fewer 0s than 1s. Hence, \emph{s} cannot be pumped and that is a violation of our assumption that C is regular. By this contradiction we can conclude that the language C is not regular.\#
\section{Question 2}
\label{sec:org8ace072}
F = \{ww | w is a string from \{0,1\}\textsuperscript{*}\}

Assume F is a regular language and let p be the pumping length of F. Choose \emph{s} = 0\textsuperscript{p}10\textsuperscript{p}1 \(\in\) F, when w = 0\textsuperscript{p}1. Clearly |0\textsuperscript{p}10\textsuperscript{p}1| \textgreater{} p. According to the puming lemma, \emph{s} can be partitioned into \emph{s} = xyz \(\in\) F such that for all i \(\ge\) 0, we have the following xy\textsuperscript{i}z \(\in\) F. By condition 3 of the pumping lemma, we must also have |xy| \(\le\) p. Therefore, y must consist only of 0s and subsequenttly xyyz = xy\textsuperscript{2}z \(\notin\) F \uline{since the first part of} the strings (substring w) does not equal the second part of the string \emph{s}. Hence, \emph{S} cannot be pumped and that is a violation of our assumption that F is regular. By this contradiction we can conclude that the language F is not regular.\#
\section{Question 3}
\label{sec:org7b00a5f}
A = \{www | w is a string from \{a,b\}\textsuperscript{*}\}

Assume A is a regular language and let p by the pumping length of A. Choose \emph{s} to be = a\textsuperscript{p}ba\textsuperscript{p}ba\textsuperscript{p}b \(\in\) A. Clearly |a\textsuperscript{p}ba\textsuperscript{p}ba\textsuperscript{p}b| \textgreater{} p. According to the pumping lemma, \emph{s} can be partitioned into \emph{s} = xyz \(\in\) A such that for all i \(\ge\) 0, we have the following xy\textsuperscript{i}z \(\in\) A. By condition 3 of the pumping lemma, we must also have |xy| \(\le\) p. Therefore, y must consist only of a's, and subsequently xyyz = xy\textsuperscript{2}z \(\notin\) A since the first substring w would now contain more a's than the second and third parts of the string \emph{s}. Hence, \emph{s} cannot be pumped and that is a violation of our assumption that A is regular. By this contradiction we can conclude that the language A is not regular.\#
\section{Question 4}
\label{sec:org506170d}
L = \{0\textsuperscript{n}1\textsuperscript{m}0\textsuperscript{n} | m,n >= 0\}

Assume L is a regular language and let p be the pumping length of L. Choose \emph{s} to be = 0\textsuperscript{p}10\textsuperscript{p} \(\in\) L. Clearly |0\textsuperscript{p}10\textsuperscript{p}| \textgreater{} p. According to the pumping lemma, \emph{s} can be partitioned into \emph{s} = xyz \(\in\) L such that for all i \(\ge\) 0, we have the following xy\textsuperscript{i}z \(\in\) L. By condition 3 of the pumping lemma, we must also have |xy| \(\le\) p. Therefore y must consist of only 0's and subsequently xyyz = xy\textsuperscript{2}z \(\notin\) L since the string \emph{s} would now contain 0\textsuperscript{p+|y|}10\textsuperscript{p}, which is \(\notin\) L. Hence, \emph{s} cannot be pumped and that is a violation of our assumption that L is regular. By this contradiction we can conclue that the language L is not regular.\#
