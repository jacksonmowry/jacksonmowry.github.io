* Theory Of Computation Introduction
The 3 componenets of problem solving
1. Unknowns
2. Data
3. Conditions

To solve a problem we need to find a way of determining the unknowns from given data such that conditions of the problem are satisfied.

The traditional areas of the theory of computation (TOC)
- Automata
  - Provide problem solving devices
- Computability
  - Provide framework that can characterize devices by their computing power
- Complexity
  - Provide framework to classify problems acording to time/space complexity of the toold used to solve them

** Automata (Automaton)
- Abstration of computing devices
- How much memory can be used?
- What operations can be performed?

** Computability
- Study different computing models and identify the most powerful ones
- Range of problems
- Problems can be undecidable or uncomputatble
  - The halting problem

** Complexity
- Computing problems range from easy to hard; sorting is easier than scheduling
- Question
  - What makes some problems computationally hard or others easy?

** Problem Abstration
Data
- Abstracted as a word in a given alphabet
Conditions
- Abstracted as a set of words called a language
Unknowns
- A boolean variable: true if a word is in the language or false other wise

*** Abstration of Data
- \Sigma: alphabet, a finite, nonempty set of symbols
- \Sigma^{*}: all words of a finite length built up using \Sigma
- Rules: (1) the empty word (\epsilon) is in \Sigma^{*}; (2) if w \in \Sigma^{*} and a \in \Sigma, then aw \in \Sigma^{*}, and (3) nothing else is in \Sigma^{*}

Example: If \Sigma = {0,1}, then \Sigma^{*} = {\epsilon,0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,010,011,...}.

**** Valid C
#+begin_src C
int my_func() { return 1; };

int main() {
    int var = my_func(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
    for (;;) {}
    // You cannot just simply change the syntax of a for loop
    for(;) {}
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
**** Invalid C++
#+begin_src C++
int my_func() { return 1; };

int main() {
    int var = my_func(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
    for (;;) {}
    // You cannot just simply change the syntax of a for loop
    for(;) {}
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Finite Automata
** Formal Language
- Some set of strings over a give alphabet
- How do you specify a language?
- How do you recognize strings in a language?
- How do you translate the language?
** Abstraction of Problems
1. Data - word in a given alphabet
   - \Sigma alphabet, a finite non-empty set of symbols
   - \Sigma^* all words of finite length built-up using \Sigma
2. Conditions - Set of words called a language
   - Any subset L \subseteq \Sigma^* is a formal language
3. Unknown - a boolean variable that is true, if word is in language; false, otherwise.
   - Given w \in \Sigma^* and L \subseteq \Sigma^*, is w \in L?
** Formal Definition
- Simplest computational model also referred to as a finite-state machine or finite automaton (FA)
- Representations: graphical, tabular, and mathmatical
- A finite automaton is a 5-tuple (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{0},F), where Q is a finite set of states, \Sigma is a finite set of symbols (alphabet), the transition function \delta maps Q X \Sigma to Q, q_0 \in Q is the start (initial) state, and F $\subseteq{}$ Q is the set of accept (final) states
- Used to design embedded systems, or compilers
*** Example
If the machine is in a start state, where the initial state is an accept state, that means that our FA can accept an empty string \epsilon
** DFA
Deterministic Finite Automata
** Applications
- Parsers for compilers
- Pattern recognition
- Speech processing and OCR
- Financial planning and market prediction
** FA Computation
- Automaton M_{1} receives input symbols one-by-one (left to right)
- After reading each symbol, M_{1} moves from one state to another along the transition that has that symbol as its label
- When M_{1} reads the last symbol of the input, it produces the output: accept if M_{1} is in an accept state, or reject if M_{1} is not in an accept state
** Language Recognition
- If L is the set of all strings that an FA M accepts, we say that L is the language of the machine M and write L(M) = L
- An automaton may accept several strings, but it always recognizes only one language
- If a machine accepts no strings, it still recognizes one language, namely the empty language 0
The machines are recognizing words in the language
Any given automaton only recognizes specifically one language
** Formal Definition of Acceptance
- LEt M = (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{0},F) be an FA and w = a_{1}a_{2}...a_{n} be a string over \Sigma. We say M accepts w if a sequence of states r_{0}r_{1}...r_{n} exist in Q such that
  - r_{0} = q_{0} (where machine starts)
  - \delta{}(r_{i},a_{i+1}) = r_{i+1}, i=0,1,...,n-1,(transitions based on \delta)
  - r_{n} \in F (input accepted)
** Regular Languages
- We say that FA recognizes the language L if L = {w | M accepts w}
- A language is called a *regular* language, if there exists an FA that recognizes it
- Q: how do you design/build an FA
** FA Design Approach
1. Identify finite pieces of information you need, i.e., the states (possibilities)
2. Identify the condition (or alphabet) to change from one state to another
3. Idenitfy the starting and final/accept states
4. Add missing transitions
** Example
Let M_{1} = (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{1},F), Q = {q_{1},q_{2},q_{3}}, \Sigma = {0,1}, and F = {q_{2}}. Let's define a transition functoin \delta for M_{1} and then draw the resulting (graph-based) *state transition diagram* for M_{1}

Language of M_{3} = C = { w | w ends in a 0 OR w is empty }

*** What does this give us?
If we flip the accept and initial state, we generate the complement of the machine (flip the meaning)

{ w | starts with 'a' AND ends with 'a' }

* Regular Languages
Let A and B be languages
Union: A \union B = { x | x \in A \vee x \in B }
Concatenation: A \circ B = { xy | x \in A \wedge y \in B }
Star: A^{*} = { x_{1}x_{2}...x_{k} | k >= 0 \wedge x_{i} \in A, 0 <= i <= k }

*** Is \epsilon always a member of A^{*} regarless of the language A?
Yes
*** What is another name for the language of A \circ A^{*}?
A^{+}

*** Closures of Regular Languages
Theorem: Class of regular languages is closed under intersection. (Proof: Use cross-product construction of states)
Theorem: Class of regular languages is closed under complementation (Proof: swap accept/non-accept states and show FA recognizes the complement)
** Nondeterminism
NFA or nondeterministic finite automata
- Every stop of a FA computation follows in a unique way from the proceeding step; a deterministic computation
- Nondeterministic computation - choices exist for the next state; a nondeterministic FA (NFA)
- Ways to introduct nondeterminism
  - more choices for next state (zero, one, many)
  - State may change to another state without reading any symbol

*** Formal Definition
a 5-tuple (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F), where Q is a finite set of states, \Sigma is a finite set of symbols (alphabet), the transition function \delta maps Q x \Sigma \union {\epsilon} to \mathbb{P}(\mathbb{Q}), q_{0} \in Q is the start (initial) state, and F $\subseteq{}$ Q is the set of accept (final) states.

Notice that the range of the transition function \delta for an NFA is the power set of Q \mathbb{P}(\mathbb{Q})

*** Formal Definition of Acceptance (NFA)
Let N  k (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F) be an NFA and w = y_{1}y_{2}...y_{n} be a string over $\Sigma_{\epsilon}=\Sigma{}\union{}{\epsilon}$. We say N accepts w if a sequence of states r_{0},r_{1},...,r_{m} exist in Q such that
1. r_{0} = q_{0}
2. \delta(r_{i},y_{i+1}) = r_{i+1} for i = 0,1,...,m-1
3. r_{m}\in{}F

*** NFA Motivation
- For some problems they are much easier to construct than a DFA
- NFA may actually be smaller than a DFA that performs the same task; but NFA computation is usually more expensive
- Every NFA can be converted into an equivalent DFA (in theory, every NFA has an equivalent DFA t orecognize the same language)
- NFAs can be used to show that regular languages are closed under union, concatenation, and star operations

Epsilon transitions happen without reading anything, allowing you to go either direction

*** DFA/NFA Equivalence
Let N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_{0}, F) be the NFA that recognizes the language A and construct the DFA M that also recognizes A. Define M = (Q', \Sigma, \delta{}', q_{0}', F').


E(R) = R \Union {q \in Q | \quantifier{}r_{1} \in R,r_{2},...,r_{k} \in{} Q, r_{i+1} \in \delta(r_{i},\epsilon), r_{k} = q}

* Nonregular Languages
R is a regular expression if
1. a for some a \in \Sigma
2. \epsilon (language contains only the empty string)
3. 0 (language has no strings)
4. (R_{1} \union R_{2}), where R_{1}, R_{2} are regular expressions
5. (R_{1} \circ R_{2}), where R_{1}, R_{2} are regular expressions
6. R_{1}^{*}, where R_{1} is a regular expression

** Language Example
Is B = {0^{n}1^{n}|n \geq 0} a regular language?
- No because one single machine cannot possible match the infinte states

*** Warning
Just because a language might seem to require unbounded (infinite) memory t orecognize it - it could still be regular

Suppose you have the following two languages: C = {w | w has an equal number of 0s and 1s} and D = {w | w has an equal number of 01 and 10 substrings}

2nd is regular?

** Example
Language D = {w|w has an equal number of 01 and 10 substrings}

We can generally create a regular language if the constraints are ordering
Generally non-regular if we have to do some sort of counting without ordering

* Pumping Lemma
- All strings in a language can be pumped if they are at least as long as a certain value called the pumping length
- Another interpretation: every string contains a section that can be repeated any number of itmes with the resulting string remaining in the language

** Example
sqrt(sqrt(sqrt(...sqrt(x)...)))

** Lemma
If A is a regular language, then there exists a number p (the pumping length) where, if s is any string in A of length of at least p, then s may be divided into three pices, s = xyz subject too

If you take any string out of the language, at least length p, then I can take that string, cut it into pieces, 3 pieces, prefix x, suffix z,

1. \forall i \geq 0, xy^{i}z \in A
   - p is an integer
   - You can also remove all y's, 0 y's
2. |y| > 0
   - The actual substring must have some chars
   - x and z can both be empty strings
3. |xy| \leq p
   - the length of x+y cannot be bigger than p

** Pumping Lemma Proof Construction
- Let M = (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{1},F) be a DFA that recognizes the language A. Assign a pumping length p to the number of states of M.
  - P (pumping length) is the number of states in M, which is finite
  - If you have finite number of states (p), and it is way bigger than p, then we will have to loop
- Show that any string s \in A, |s| \geq p may be broken into xyz satisfying the three PL conditions
  -
- If there are no strings in A of length at least p, then the PL is true because all three conditions hold for all strings of length at least p (if there are NO such strings)

** Proof
Recognizes A and let p be the size of Q, let s = s_{1}s_{2}...s_{n} be a string over \Sigma with n \geq p and r = r_{1}r_{2}...r_{n+1} be the sequence of states encountered while processing

*** Example
We know that n+1 \geq p+1, why?
- because n \geq p

The among the first p+1 elements in the sequence r..., there must be a repeating state, say r_{j},r_{k} what principle is this based on?
- Pigeon hole principle

Let r_{k} be the recurring state among the first p+1 states in the sequence starting with r_{1}, so k \leq p+1. Let x = s_{1}s_{2}...s_{j-1}, y = s_{j}s_{j+1}...s_{k-1}, and z = s_{k}s_{k+1}...s_{n}

So X takes M from r_{1} to r_{j}, Y takes M from r_{j} to r_{j} and Z takes M from r_{j} to r_{n+1}; recall that r_{j} == r_{k} and that r_{n+1} is an accept state
Therefore:
- M must accept xy^{i}z, for i \geq 0 (*Condition 1*)
- Since j \neq k then |y| \gt 0 (*Condition 2*)
- Since k \le p + 1 then |xy| \leq p (*Condition 3*)

** Technique
- Assume the language is regular, and assume a contradiction
- PL guarantees existence of a pumping length p such that all strings of length p or greater (in A) can be pumped
- Find s \in A, |s| \geq p that cannot be pumped; consider all the ways of dividing s int ox,y,z and show that for each division, at least one of the PL conditions fail to hold
- pumping length = number of states in a minimalist machine

*** Example
B = {0^{n}1^{n} | n \geq 0} is not regular

Assume B is regular and let p be the pumping length for B. Choose s = 0^{p}1^{p} \in B so that clearly s \ge p. By the PL, we can partition s = xyz such that for all i \geq 0, xy^{i}z \in B. Let's consider three possible cases for the contents of substring y

Think about what the string is, in our case s = 00...011...1, where our length is now 2p, p 0's followed by p 1's.

|   x |    y |   z |
| 000 | 0011 | 111 |

**** Options
1. Y consists of only 0's
   - x   | y  | z
   - 0000|...0|111.11
   - Then S' = xyyz
   - Then S' has more 0's than 1's, therefore it is no longer in the language
   - Hence, xyyz \notin B, a violation of condition 1 of the PL
   - Y consists only of 0's. Then S' = xyyz has more 0's than 1's since |y| > 0 by condition 2. Hence, xyyz \notin{} B. This is a violation of condition 1 of the PL.
2. Y consists of only 0's
   - Y consists only of 1's. Then S' = xyyz has more 1's than 0's since |y| > 0 by condition 2. Hence, xyyz \notin{} B. This is a violation of condition 1 of the PL.
3. Y consists of 0's and 1's
   - Y consists of 0's and 1's. Then s' = xyyz may have the same number of 0's and 1's, but they are out of order (i.e some 1's occur before 0's), and so s' = xyyz \notin{} B. This is a violation of condition 1 of the PL.

** How might the proof above be simplified using condition 3 of the PL to constrain the contents of the substring y?
According to condition 3, we must have |xy| <= p.

We picked s = 0000000|1111111, both of length p
xy is already p length, therefore the language only contains 0's.
y could only contain 0's and we have contradiction in case 1 for all y

*** Example
i = 2
New string is xz


** Conditions
- If a language is regular, one should be able to take any string out of that language, partition it into 3 parts XYZ, with the Y componenet having something in it, then you can pump that string
- \forall{} i \geq 0, XY^{i}Z has to be in the language, if i = 0 we are pumping down, if i \gt 1 we are pumping up
- We only have to find one i that breaks the conditions, because the condition says \forall{} i's

- if i = 1, then we are not pumping, that is just the same string
- When i \geq 2 then we are pumping up
- When i \eq 0 then we are pumping down

** Example Again
Use the PL to prove that the language E = {0^{i}1^{j} | i > j} is not regular.

Assume E is regular and let p be the pumping length for E. Choose s = 0^{p+1}1^{p} \in E so that clearly s > p. By the PL, we can partition s = xyz such that for all i >= 0, xy^{i}z \in E. By condition 3 of the pumping lemma, we must have |xy| \leq p. Therefore, y must contain only 0's. Is it possible for s' = xyyz to be in the language? Adding an additional copy of y increases the number of 0's which does not violate the constraints of the language. But setting i = 0 does violate the condition since we would now have 0^p and 1^p, or more generally i <= j. Subsequently s' would \notin E, given this contradiction of conditoin 1 of the PL, we can conclude E is not regular.

Start with condition 3 of the PL to determine the contents of substring y and see if you can get a violation of Condition 1 of the PL for any choice of y.

** Another example
*** Language 1
L_{1} = {a^{i}ba^{j} | 0 \leq i < j}
- ba
- Assume L_{1} is regular with pumping length p
- Choose s = a^{p}ba^{p+1}
- State cond 1, s = xyz \forall i \geq 0 xy'z \in L_{1}
- Use condition 3 (|xy| \leq p), and condition 2 (|y| > 0)
- y contains only a's
- Pumping up violates the constraint i < j, because xyyz would result in i is now greater than j, which means j is no longer strictly greater than i
- Therefore s' \notin L_{1}, a's before b are greater than or equal to those after b

* Context Free Languages
We have shown that L = {0^{n}1^{n} | n \geq 0} cannot be specified by a FA or regular expression; Context-Free Grammars (or CFGs) provide a more powerful way to specify languages. A CFG is a 4-tuple (V, \Sigma, R, S), where
- V is a finite set of symbols (variable or nonterminals)
- \Sigma is a finite set of symbols disjoint from V (terminals)
- R is a finite set of specification rules of the form /lhs/ \rightarrow{} /rhs/, /lhs/ \in V, /rhs/ \in (V \union \Sigma), and S \in V is the start variable

** Example
CFG G_{1} has the following specification rules
\[
A \rightarrow{} 0A1
\]
\[
A \rightarrow{} B
\]
\[
B \rightarrow{} \#
\]

The start variable for G_{1} is A.
What are the nonterminals?
- A, B
What are the terminals?
- 0, 1, #

** Language Specification
1. Write down start variable; /lhs/ of first spec rule
2. Find variable that is written down and a rule whose /lhs/ is that variable; replace the written down variable with the /rhs/ of that rule
3. Repeat Step 2 until no variables remain in string

*** Example
Use the CFG G_{1} (above) to derive the string 000#111. Show derivation and corresponding parse tree

** Direct Derivation
If u,v,w \in (V \union \Sigma)^{*}, i.e., are strings of variables and terminals, and A \rightarrow{} w \in R is a grammar rule, then we say that uAv yields uwv or uAv \Rightarrow{} uwv. Alternatively, uwv is directly derived from uAv using the rule A \rightarrow w.

** Derivation
\[
S \rightarrow aSb
\]
\[
S \rightarrow SS
\]
\[
S \rightarrow \epsilon
\]

** Applications
- Compiler design and implementation
- Programming language specificatoin
- Scanner, parsers, and code generators

** Design Techniques
1. CFG Design Technique
   - Many CFGs are unions of simpler CFGs
   - Combination involves putting all the rules together and adding the new rules
   - s \rightarrow s_{1}|s_{2}|...|s_{k}
     - where the variables s_{i}, 1 \leq i \leq k, are the start variables of the invidivual grammars and the s is a new variable

#+begin_src C
int a = 5;

return a + a a;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
*** Design a Language Example
CFG G = ({S,B}, {a,b}, {S \rightarrow{} aSB|B|\epsilon{}, B \rightarrow{} bB|b} S)

{a^{n}b^{m} | n <= m}

** Ambiguous Grammar
Consider the CFG G_{5} that has the rules E \rightarrow{} E + E | E * E | (E) | a.

For this out by parsing left to right

*** Derivation Order
It is possible for 2 derivations to produce hte same derivation becuase htey differ in the order

Leftmost derivation, replace the leftmost nonterminal first
Rightmost Derivation, replace the rightmost nonterminal at each step

*** Example
\Sigma{} = {a,b,c}
A = {a^{i}b^{j}c^{k} | i = j \vee{} j = k \hat{} (i,j,k \geq 0)}

Rules
- S \rightarrow{} E_{ab}C | AE_{bc}
- E_{ab} \rightarrow{} aE_{ab}b | \epsilon{}
- E_{bc} \rightarrow{} bE_{bc}C | \epsilon{}
- C \rightarrow{} Cc | \epsilon{}
- A \rightarrow{} aA|\epsilon{}

Based on the rules defined above:
S \rightarrow{} E_{ab}C \rightarrow{} C \rightarrow{} \epsilon{}
S \rightarrow{} AE_{bc} \rightarrow{} A \rightarrow{} \epsilon{}

How can we eliminate the ambiguity?

Remove the epsilons from the RHS
- C \rightarrow{} Cc | *c*
- A \rightarrow{} aA| *a*

Leave the intial 2 rules alone, *but we removed the empty string*
- S \rightarrow{} E_{ab}C | AE_{bc} | *\epsilon{}* | *E_{ab}* | *E_{bc}*

** Real World Example
#+begin_src
<s> ::= <v>=<e>
     | <s>;<s>
     | if <b> then <s>
     | if <b> then <s> else <s>
<v> ::= x|y|z
<e> ::= <v>|0|1|2|3|4
<b> ::= <e> === <e>

x=1; y=2; if x === y then y = 3
#+end_src

*** Parse Tree 1
if x === 1 then
        if y === z then
                z = 2
                else z = 3
        else z = 4

** Chomsky Normal Form
The CNF is a simplification procedure for CFGs. jthe format for rules in CNF has one of two forms
- A \rightarrow{} BC (or A \rightarrow{} AC)
  - Variable producing 2 variables on the right
- A \rightarrow{} a
  - The rule causes a termination
  - where a is a terminal and A,B,C are nonterminals and B,C may not be the start variable.
  - The rule S \rightarrow{} \epsilon{} for the start variable S is not excluded

*** Not in CNF
- A \rightarrow{} aa

* Pushdown Automata
A pushdown automata (or PDA) is similar to an NFA but it has a stack. The stack provides additional memory beyond finite memory available in control; it allows the PDA to recognize some nonregular languages.

2 options to prove htat a language is context-free
- Construct a CFG that generates it
- Construct a PDA that recognizes it

Some CFLs are more easily descibed in terms of their generators, whereas others are more easily described in terms of their recognizers. Let's draw a schematic representation of the difference between an NFA and a PDA.

** Terminology
- Writing a symbol on the stack is called pushing the symbol
- Removing a symbol from the stack is called popping the symbol
- All access to the stack may be done only at the top (LIFO storage device)

The primary benefit of that stack is that it can hold an *unlimited* amount of data; a PDA can recognize {0^{n}1^{n} | n \geq 0} because it can use the stack to remember that number of 0s it has seen (read)

** Informal Algorithm for {0^{n}1^{n} | n \geq 0}
1. Read symbols from the input, push a 0 for each 0 you see
2. As soon as a 1 is read, pop a 0 off the stack (for each 1 read).
3. If input finishes when the stack become empty, accept; if stack becomes empty while there is still input or input finishes while the stack is not empty, reject.

A PDA may be nondeterminisitic. Languages as the one above do not require nondeterminism. However, the language {ww^{R} | w \in {0,1}^{*}} would require nondeterminism. Why?

** Formalization
- A PDA may different alphabets for input (\Sigma{}) and stack (\Gamma{})
- Nondeterminism allows for the PDA to make transitions on empty input. Define \Sigma{}_{\epsilon} = \Sigma{} \union {\epsilon} and \Gamma{}_{\epsilon} = \Gamma{} \union{} {\epsilon}
- The domain of the PDA transition function is Q x \Sigma{}_{\epsilon{}} x \Gamma{}_{\epsilon{}}, where Q is the set of states
- The range of the PDA transition funciton is P(Q x \Gamma{}_{\epsilon{}}).
\[
\delta{}: Q x \Sigma{}_{\epsilon{}} x \Gamma{}_{\epsilon} \rightarrow{} P(Q x \Gamma{}_{\epsilon})
\]

** Formal Def
A PDA is a 6-tuple (Q, \Sigma{}, \Gamma{}, \delta, q_{0}, F), where Q, \Sigma{}, \Gamma{} are finite sets of states

** PDA Computation
A PDA M = (Q,\Sigma{},\Gamma{},\delta{},q_{0},F) computes as follows...
M inputs w = w_{1}w_{2}...w_{m}, where each w_{i} \in \Sigma{}_{\epsilon}
1. r_{0} = q_{0},s_{0} = \epsilon{}; begin with state state and empty stack
2. (r_{i+1},b) \in \delta(r_{i},w_{i+1},a), i = 0,1,...m-1, where s_{i} = at and s_{i+1} = bt for some a,b \in \Gamma{} and t \in{} \Gamma{}^{*}
3. r_{m} \in F; accept state encountered at end of input

** Stack Notation
a,b \rightarrow{} or simply abc
- a = input
- b = what are you popping
- c = push onto stack
A is read from the input, b is poppped from the stack, and c is pushed onto the stack
\epsilon{}-cases
- If a = \epsilon{}, machine can transition without reading any input
- if b = \epsilon{}, machine can transition without popping any symbol from the stack
- if c = \epsilon{}, machine can transition without writing any symbol onto the stack

read pop push

** Empty Stack
The PDA does not consider the testing of an empty stack. We can achieve this by initially placing a special char (say $) on the stack. When the PDA encounters that char ($) again (on the stack), it knows the stack is effectively empty.

Both CFGs and PDAs specify context-free languages; we can always convert a CFG into a PDA that recognizes the language of the CFG

** Theorem
CFG - specifies a program language
PDA - specifies/implements the compiler

A language is context-free \iff{} some PDA recognizes it

** Difficulties
How do we decide which substitutions to make for a derivation? (PDA P nondeterminism can help)
- At each step of the derivation one of the rules for a particular variable is selected non-deterministically
- P has to start by writing the start variable on the stack and then continue working the string w
- If while consuming the string w, P arrives at a string of terminals that equals w

** Informal Description
Place marker symbol $ and tart varaible on the stack
Repeat:
- If TOS is a variable symbol A, non-deterministically select a rule r such that lhs(r) = A and substitute A by the string rhs(s)
- If TOS is a terminal symbol, a, read the next input symbol and compare it with a; if they match, pop the stack; if they do not match, reject this branch of nondeterminism
- If TOS is a $ and all the text has been read, accept; otherwise reject

** Generic State Diagram
1. TOS = variable: set \delta(q_{loop}, \epsilon{}, A) = {(q_{loop}, w) | A \rightarrow{} w \in R}, where R is the set of CFG rules
2. TOS = terminal: set \delta(q_{loop}, a, a}) = {(q_{loop}, \epsilon{}})
3. TOS = $: \delta(q_{loop}, \epsilon, $) = {(q_{accept}, \epsilon)}

* Pumping Lemmas
Pumping Lemma for CFLs
- If A is a CFL, then there exists a number p (the pumping length) where, if s is any string in A of length of at least p, then s may be divided into 5 pieces, s = uvxyz, satisfying the folloing conditions
  1. \forall{}i \geq{} 0, uv^{i}xy^{i}z \in A
  2. |vy| > 0 (i.e., either v or y is not \epsilon{})
  3. |vxy| \leq{} p (i.e., the interior cannot be larger than p).

** Schmatic Proof
Proof, Let A be a CFL and G be the CFG that generates A. We have to show that any sufficiently long s \in A can be pumped and remain in A.
- Because s \in a, it is derivable from G and say has a derivation tree D_{s}
- The tree D_{s} must be very tall (for a long s)
- So d_{s} contains some relatively long path from the start variable (at root) to a terminal at a leaf
- On such a long path, some variable X must be repeated due to the pigeonhole principle
- The repetition of X allows for the replacement of a subtree under the second occurrence of X to be replaced by the subtree under the first occurrence of X

So we may cut s into five pieces and repeat the 2nd and 4th partitions to obtain uv^{i}xy^{i}z \in A, for any i \geq 0

** Example
Use the PL for CFLs to prove that the language B = {a^{n}b^{n}c^{p} | n \geq{} 0} is not at CFL.

u | v | x | y | z
aaaaa|bbbbb|ccccc

Assume B is a CFL and let p be the pumping length for B. Choose s = a^{p}b^{p}c^{p} \in B so that clearly s > p. By condition 1 of the PL for CFLs, we can partition s = uvxyz such that for all i \geq{} 0, uv^{i}xy^{i}z \in B. In order to show that s cannot be pumped, let's consider the ramifications of Condition 2 of the PL for CFLs for the contents of v and y

When both v and y contain only one type of symbol (terminal). V does not contain both a's and b's or both b's and c's and the same holds for y. Then s' = uv^{2}xy^{2}z cannot contain equal numbers of a's b's and c's. Therefor s' \notin{} B and condition 1 of the PL for CFLs is violated.

When either v or y contain more than one type of symbol (terminal). S' uv^{2}xy^{2}z may contain equal numbers of these symbols but the symbols are in the wrong order. Hence s' \notin B, becasue condition 1 of PL(CFLs) is violated since one of the above cases must apply for any s \in B, we can conclude that B is not a CFL.#

** Example
C = {a^{i}b^{j}c^{k} | 0 \leq i \leq j \leq k} is not a CFL.

Choose s = a^{p}b^{p}c^{p} \in C so that clearly s > p. By condition 1 of the PL for CFLs, we can partition s = uvxyz such that for all i \geq 0, uv^{i}xy^{i}z.

*** Case The a's do not appear
In htis case either the a's and c's cannot appear in V & y:w

because both cannot be the empty string due to cond 2
If a's appear in S' = uv^{2}xy^{2}z, the s' has more a's than b's and so S' \notin C. Similarily if c's appear in s' = uv'{0}xy^{y}z
