* Summary
The researchers in this paper demonstrate how spiking neural networks may be used as a brain-machine interface, specifically for control tasks. The issue explored is the control of a prosthetic limb, through the observation and interpretation of brain signals, which are typically used to control the limb being replaced. The observation is accomplished through the embedding of an electrode array on the head of the test subject (in this case a monkey).

The end goal of collecting these observations is to apply a Kalman filter to translate instantaneous velocity into an absolute position. For the purposes of this paper, the observations were used to allow a monkey to control a cursor on a screen. The monkeys were trained to move the cursor between various control points through moving their arm, which in turn allowed the brain signals to be monitored and translated into velocity measurements. For the online portion of data collection the recorded measurements were fed through a traditional Kalman filter, and 3 sizes of spiking neural networks, each of which were controlling a cursor on the screen. The researchers additionally tested offline, in which they simply compared the calculated position to the observed position, tracked via a traditional camera with a tracking dot on the monkey's finger.

Overall, the researchers found little difference in the time it took for a monkey to adapt to the spiking-neural-network based control scheme as opposed to the Kalman filter. However, the spiking-neural-network approach consumed much less power, they quote less than 50nW per silicon neuron. Which puts their best performing network (20,000 neurons) at a total consumption of ~1mW. Kalman filter approaches range from 5mW to 14mW, which is approaching or exceeding the dangerous limits of how much heat can be dissipated that close to someone's brain (~10mW for the targeted package size).

Sadly, the research presented in the paper used a neuromorphic simulator (Nengo) to process the data, meaning all processing was happening off-board, with no constraints on power or size. They were however successful in closely matching the state-of-the-art Kalman filters, with 3% and 6% error on networks of 20,000 and 2,000 neurons respectively.
