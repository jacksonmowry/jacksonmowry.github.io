#+title: Operating Systems

* Chapter 2
- We have abstractions that allow a single program to behave as the only process on the machine
- Mechanisms are how is the code implemented
- Policies are how we decide when to use the mechanisms
- Primary way we expose resources is through virtualization
  - CPU, RAM, disk
  - Make virtual forms for the program to use
** Evolution
- Early OS was just a lib, only one process at a time
- Then we gain protections, raw data storage is dangerous
- Then we gained multiprogramming. Running more than one job at a time
- As we talk about various OS pieces, we will show the evolution into the modern versions .
