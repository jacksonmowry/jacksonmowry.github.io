#+title: One Two
* Example
\left (
\begin{array}{ccc|c}
1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3
\end{array}
\right )

Now apply the row operation from example 3, section 1.1 (we will come back to this)


* Gausian Elimination
** Reduced Row Echelon Form
1. If a row does not consist entirely of zeros, then the first nonzero number in the row is a 1, this is called a leading 1
2. If there are any rows that consist entirely of zeros, then they are grouped together at the bottom of the matrix
3. In any 2 seuccessive rows that do not consist entirely of zeros, the leading 1 in the lower rows occurs farther to the right than the leading 1 in the higher row.
4. Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else in the column

A matrix that has props 1-3 is in *row echelon form*, thus a matrix in reduced row echelon form is of necessity in row echelon form.

*** Example 1
Which of these are in reduced echelon form
