* Diagonal Matricies
A square matrix in which ale entries off the main diagonal are zero is called a diagonal matrix

$\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\0&-5\end{bmatrix}$
$\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$
$\begin{bmatrix}6&0&0&0\\0&-4&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\0&0&0&8\end{bmatrix}$
$\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\0&0\end{bmatrix}$

A general n x n diagonal matrix D can be written as
$\begin{bmatrix}d_1&0&...&0\\0&d_2&...&0\\...&...&...&...\\0&0&...&d_n\end{bmatrix}

A diagonal matrix is invertible if and only if all of its diagonal entries are nonzero; in this case the inverse of it is
$D^{-1} \begin{bmatrix}1/d_1 & 0 & ... & 0\\0 & 1/d_{2} & ... & 0\\...&...&...&...\\0 & 0 & ... & 1/d_{n}\end{bmatrix}$

Powers of a diagonal matrix
$D^{k} = \begin{bmatrix}d_{1}^{k} & 0 & ... & 0 \\ 0 & d_{2}^{k} & ... & 0 \\ ... & ... & ... & ... \\ 0 & 0 & ... & d_{n}^{k}\end{bmatrix}$

Given A below, find A^{-1}, A^{5} and A^{-5}

$A = \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&-3&0\\0&0&2\end{bmatrix}$

A inverse and A^{-1} are the same thing if and only if A is a diagonal matrix

$A^{-5} = \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&\frac{-1}{243}&0\\0&0&\frac{1}{32}\end{bmatrix}$


* Triangular Matricies
A square matrix in which ale entries above the main diagonal are zero is called lower triangluar, and a square matrix in which all the entires below the main diagonal are zero is called upper triangular. A matrix that is either upper or lower triangular is called triangular

- A square matrix in row echelon form is upper triangular since it has zeros below the main diagonal

** Theorem
a. The transpose of a lower triangluar matrix is upper triangluar, and the transpose of an upper triangular matrix is lower triangular
b. The product of lower triangular matricies is lower tri, and the product of upper is upper
c. A triangular matrix is invertible if and only if its diagonal entries are all nonzero
d. The inverse of an invertible lower triangular matrix is lower triangular, and the inverse of and invertible upper triangular matrix is upper triangular

** Practice
$A = \begin{bmatrix}1&3&-1\\0&2&4\\0&0&5\end{bmatrix} B = \begin{bmatrix}3&-2&2\\0&0&-2\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}$

A is invertible, B is not, cell 2,2 is 0

* Symmetric Matricies
A square matrix A is said to be *symmetric* if A = A^{T}

$\begin{bmatrix}7&-3\\-3&5\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&4&5\\4&-3&0\\5&0&7\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}d_1&0&0&0\\0&d_2&0&0\\0&0&d_{3}&0\\0&0&0&d_{4}\end{bmatrix}$

Easy to recognize a symmetric matrix by inspection, the entries on the main diagonal have no restrictions, but mirror images of entires across the main diagonal must be equal
$(A)_{ij} = (A)_{ji}$

** Theorem
If A and B are symmetric matrcies with the same size, and if k is any scalar, then;
- A^T is symmetric
- A+B and A-B are symmetric
- kA is symmetric

The product of two symmetric matricies is symmetric iff the matricies commute (AB = BA)
$\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\2&3\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-4&1\\1&0\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-2&1\\-5&2\end{bmatrix}$
$\begin{bmatrix}1&2\\2&3\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-4&3\\3&-1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2&1\\1&3\end{bmatrix}$
This guy is symmetric, because AB in this case commute, meaning BA would give the same results

a = [1,2;2,3]
b = [-4,3;3,-1]

*** If A is an invertible symmetric matrix, then A^{-1} is symmetric
- Assume A is symmetric, then we want to show A^{-1} is symmetric
- From theorem A = A^{T}
$(A^{-1})^T = (A^T)^{-1} = A^{-1}$
So, since (A^{-1})^T = A^{-1}, then A^{-1} is symmetric

*** If A is an invertible matrix, then AA^{T} and A^{T}A are also invertible


** AA^{T} and A^{T}A are Symmetric
If A is an m x n matrix, then A^{T} is an n x m matrix
$(AA^T)^{T} = (A^T)^{T}A^{T} = AA^T and (A^{T}A)^{T} = A^{T}(A^{T})^{T} = A^{T}A


$A = \begin{bmatrix}1&-2&4\\3&0&-5\end{bmatrix}$
$A^{T} = \begin{bmatrix}1&3\\-2&0\\4&-5\end{bmatrix}$
$AA^{T}\begin{bmatrix}21&-17\\-17&34\end{bmatrix}$

** Skew Symmetric
A matrix A is *Skey Symmetric* if A^{T} = -A
$A = \begin{bmatrix}0&-1\\1&0\end{bmatrix}$
$A^{T} = \begin{bmatrix}0&1\\-1&0\end{bmatrix} = -A$

*** Square
If A is an n x n matrix then A - A^{T} is skew symmetric


$\begin{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}$
$\begin{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}$
