#+title: Four Two
* Definition
- A subspace of a vector space V is a non-empty subset S of V that with the same operations from V is a vector space itself
  - What is a subset? What is a subspace?
    - any non-empty collection of vectors from V such that the 10 axioms of vector space V holds
    - Any collection of vectors from the set is a subset

* Theorem
S is a subspace of a vector space V, (with the operations from V), if
- S is a non-empty subset of V
- for any elements s_{1} and s_{2} in S, s_{1}+s_{2} \in S
- For any real number k and s \in S, ks \in S

If w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{r} are subspaces of a vector space V, then the intersection of these subspaces is also a subspace of V

For any vector space V, {0} and V are alway subspaces

* Is This a Subspace?
1. Prove or Disprove that the set S = {(a,b) | a,b are integers} with the standard operations, is a subspace of R^{2}
   - Violates original axiom 6
   - Violates property 3 for subspaces
2. Prove of Disprove that the set S = {(a,b) | b = 3a+1, a,b \in R} is a subspace of R^{2}
   - Doesn't belong
   - u+v \notin S, \therefore{} S is not a subspace
3. Prove or Disprove that the set S = {(a,b) | b = 3a, a,b \in R} is a subspace of R^{2}
   - (1,3) \in S
   - u+v
     - (1, 3) + (2, 6) = (3, 9)
     - (4, 12) + (100, 300) = (104, 312)
   - ku
     - 42(1,3) = (42, 126)
4. List all subspaces of R^{2} and R^{3}
   - {(0,0), R^{2}, any line through the origin of R^{2} (because the sum of any 2 lines passing through the origin is a line passing through the origin as well)}
5. Prove or Disprove that the set S = {$\begin{bmatrix}a\\3a\\7a\end{bmatrix}$ | a \in R} with the standard operations, is a subspace of M_{3\times{}1}
   - [a;3a;7a] + [7a; 21a; 49a] = [8a; 24a; 56a;]
   - 3[a;3a;7a] = [3a;9a;21a]
6. Prove or Disprove that the set S = {$\begin{bmatrix}a\\3a\\7\end{bmatrix}$ | a \in R} with the standard operations, is a subspace of M_{3\times{}1}
   - non empty [1;3;7]
   - [1a;3a;7] + [1b;3b;7] = [a+b;3a+3b;14] = [a+b;3(a+b);14] \notin S
